The discarded afterbirth of my lavalink client

---

## Why?

Well, awhile ago when I was first making discord bots with lavalink I told my friend 2D that I would make a lavalink client. That ended up never happening because a) im a lazy shit and b) idfk where to start. I started to then work on neocord and my shitty discord library daubu, and I understand websockets much more. So now I'm here, making this shitty lavalink wrapper. So yeah, have fun.
